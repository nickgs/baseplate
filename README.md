# Base Plate
A dead simple theme for Drupal 8


# Goals
The goals of this theme is to learn how to leverage external tools to enable the fast development of themes with Drupal 8.

# To Use
1. Clone into /themes/baseplate
2. Run npm install
3. Run gulp watch.

Note: gulp watch can take a proxy parameter like so:

gulp watch --proxy=mylocalsite.dev

This will allow you to use browser-sync with your own local Drupal install. If no proxy parameter is passed then 'drupal.dev' is the default.
